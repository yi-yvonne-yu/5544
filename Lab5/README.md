- data preparation. Generate the small and the large scale CSV.  
    - generated by make_region.py -> life_expectancy_regions.csv and ife_expectancy_regions_samples.csv
-  apply core vis principles to begin with a task and use one task only.
Start by choosing a question you’d like a visualization to answer. e.g., what is the country with the largest life-expectancy? or is there a correlation between 
life expectancy and region over the year? Is there outlier in the data?   
    - correlation between life expectancy and region over the year
- Ask AI to take the small data as an input and generate a chart and the code in D3 that can answer your question. 
    - button one: use life_expectancy_regions.csv
- Ask AI to take the large data as an input and generate a chart and the code in D3 that can answer your question. 
    - button two: use life_expectancy_regions_sample.csv
- Is AI aware of different data size and does it give you the same code/visualization style? 
    - sample code and visuallization style 
- After these generation step, practice critique AI-generated ideas and D3 code by listing the set of guidelines it should have followed, e.g., need legend when color is used; draw a different chart when you don't think the chart representation fits your task. 
    - Match chart to question: time → line; latest comparison → bar; correlation → scatter. Switch chart if the question changes.
    - Be clear on data: specify indicator + units; drop NaNs; exclude aggregates when analyzing regions; state how you aggregate (mean per Region–Year).
    - Scales & axes: linear y-scale; integer year ticks; clear axis titles with units; sensible tick density.
    - Color & legend: use a colorblind-safe palette and always include a legend when color encodes region.
    - Layout: give labels space (bigger left margin for y-label outside); keep aspect ratio readable.
    - Interactivity: tooltips with region/value; clear dataset toggle with visible active state.
    - Missing data: don’t draw through gaps (line.defined); annotate/omit very sparse series.
    - Clutter control: consider highlight-on-hover or small multiples if lines overlap heavily.
    - Consistency: keep y-domain stable across dataset toggles when you want visual comparability.
    - Transparency: note data source (WDI) and any sampling/aggregation choices (e.g., 20% sampling, seed).
- ask AI to add items you think it does not do properly one-by-one. Please fix one at a time. 
    - legacy_1 -> legacy_2
- ask AI to fix one-by-one. When it cannot, please fix it yourself. In this assignment, you only need to fix one of the things AI cannot fix.
    - legacy_2 -> new
- ask AI to justify its design choices.
